859=Deployer could not suspend the "{0}" scheduled service type with service name "{1}" because it was deployed to a clustered Integration Server.
860=Deployer could not resume the scheduled service type "{0}" with service name "{1}". The service was deployed to a clustered Integration Server and could not be resumed. You must resume the service manually at each target.
861=Scheduled services are being deployed to a clustered Integration Server and cannot be started after deployment.
862=Scheduled services have been deployed to a clustered Integration Server and were not suspended after deployment. If suspension is required, then do so manually at each target.
863=Scheduled Services are being deployed to a clustered Integration Server, and can not be suspended after deployment.  If suspension is required, then do so manually at each target after deployment.  Another way to accomplish that is by deploying to each of the individual Integration Servers in the cluster - please see documentation.
864=Deployer requires that scheduled services be updated at a clustered Integration Server, but this is not supported with this release. You can update the scheduled services by deploying them to each of the individual Integration Servers in the cluster.
865=The deployment requests that Scheduled Services be deleted from a clustered Integration Server, which is not supported with this release.  You can do the delete by going to each of the individual Integration Servers in the cluster - please see documentation.
866=Invalid input - 
867=During simulation we cannot check any variable substitution values, if you have made them, of Extended Settings. That check can only occur during deployment.
868=Extended Settings were not deployed because one of the setting values was invalid; please check the variable-substitution values shown in the Simulation report to determine which one. To further aid you, the Integration Server returned the following message\: "{0}".
869=The deployment failed and Deployer is performing an automatic rollback. Please see the separate rollback report for more information about the failed deployment.
